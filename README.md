## Modifications

The only modifications I, [@zbeekman], have made to these documents are:

1. The inclusion of the [Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license]
1. The inclusion of the [AIAA Presentation Template] from the
   [AIAA Technical Presenter Resources] page
1. The [UseLATEX] [CMake] package by [@kmorel] is provided via a Git submodule
1. This README.md is original work by me, [@zbeekman], and not distributed with
   the original AIAA documents/examples/template
1. Formatting to the original source code, in particular, [`main.tex`], may
   be altered; in particular, there may be white space changes such as the
   replacement of CRLF line endings with LF line endings, the use of spaces
   rather than tab characters, and line breaks within paragraphs of the
   source code may be added to prevent word wrapping in text editors.
